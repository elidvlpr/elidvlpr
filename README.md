ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! Iâ€™m a passionate web developer focused on building efficient and user-friendly systems. 
Currently working on projects like a College Grading System (using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL) and a School Website Design Page.
I love solving problems, streamlining processes, and creating clean, responsive designs.
